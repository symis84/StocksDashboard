#Test Description
Create a currency ticker component

For this task the candidate is expected to demonstrate good software design and implementation. The task is expected to take 1-2 hours, no longer. The finished output should look professional.

The task

Using one of the available free price APIs on the internet (e.g. Alphavantage), create a currency ticker component that retrieves and displays the exchange rates for the following currency pairs:
